#What is Task x Task?

Task x Task provides a service platform for connecting users seeking assistance with a task with skilled Taskers. Taskers are skilled individuals committed to completing task postings and strive to exceed expectations. 

Task x Task is a web application based on the popular freelance marketplace company TaskRabbit. 

#Technologies 
The site is hosted on heroku, a platform as a service that enables developers to build applications on the cloud. Ruby on Rails is used on the backend to manage a postgreSQL database structure, while the frontend is managed by a JavaScript framework and library (React + Redux). 

Useful ruby gems includes:

* b-crypt
* pry-rails
* annotate

Useful frontend modules includes:

* babel
* react/redux libraries

The site offers users an insight to the website through a demostrative login user account. This account gives potential users freedom to preview what Task x Task can provide as an online platform. The challenging part of this feature was to properly seed the database both on the application and cloud based side.

Another feature I'm proud of is the Task Form page that shows the user which page of the form they are currently on.
